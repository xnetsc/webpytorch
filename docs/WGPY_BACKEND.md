# wgpy: WebGL accelerated numpy-compatible array library for web browser

wgpy is a WebGL accelerated numpy-compatible array library for web browsers. It runs on [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/), the python runtime which runs on the web browser. Deep learning can also be performed on GPUs in conjunction with [Chainer](https://github.com/chainer/chainer).

For core implementation technique, please refer to [our arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00279).

# Demo

You can actually run WgPy in your web browser at [the demo site](https://wgpy-demo.web.app/).

# Example

With WgPy, such CuPy-compatible Python code can be executed on the GPU in a web browser.

```python
def mandelbrot(real, imag, n_iters):
    xp = cp.get_array_module(real) # get numpy or wgpy depending on the input
    xs = xp.zeros((real.size, imag.size), dtype=np.float32)
    ys = xp.zeros((real.size, imag.size), dtype=np.float32)
    count = xp.zeros((real.size, imag.size), dtype=np.int32)
    for _ in range(n_iters):
        xs, ys = xs * xs - ys * ys + real, xs * ys * 2.0 + imag
        count += ((xs * xs + ys * ys) < 4.0).astype(np.int32)
    return count
```

For efficient execution, a custom kernel can also be implemented.

```python
# WebGPU custom kernel
ElementwiseKernel(
    in_params="f32 real, f32 imag",
    out_params="i32 c",
    operation="""
c = 0;
var x: f32 = 0.0;
var y: f32 = 0.0;
for(var k: u32 = 0u; k < 500u; k = k + 1u) {
    var nx: f32 = x * x - y * y + real;
    var ny: f32 = x * y * 2.0 + imag;
    x = nx;
    y = ny;
    if (x * x + y * y < 4.0) {
        c = c + 1;
    }
}
    """,
    name=f"mandelbrot",
)
```

```python
# WebGL custom kernel
ElementwiseKernel(
    in_params="float real, float imag",
    out_params="int c",
    operation="""
c = 0;
float x = 0.0;
float y = 0.0;
for (int k = 0; k < 500; k++) {
    float nx = x * x - y * y + real;
    float ny = x * y * 2.0 + imag;
    x = nx;
    y = ny;
    if (x * x + y * y < 4.0) {
        c = c + 1;
    }
}
    """,
    name=f"mandelbrot_500",
)
```

# System Structure

WgPy runs on the web browser. The following figure shows the system structure.

<img src="images/mandelbrot.png" width="50%">

# Setup Environment

Python 3.11 and Node.js 16 are required.

## Downloading Pyodide

```
./scripts/download-pyodide.sh
```

## Install dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install
```

# Build

```
npm run build
```

The output is placed in the `dist` directory.
The Pyodide is expected to work on WebWorker, not the main thread, because wgpy is mainly forcusing for running heavy tasks. 
`{wgpy-main.js,wgpy-worker.js}` are the JavaScript library. The `wgpy-main.js` needs to be loaded in the main thread (using `<script>` tag). It calls the WebGL API following the commands from WebWorker. `wgpy-worker.js` has to be loaded in WebWorker thread (using `importScripts`). This script exposes an interface to the wgpy python library and proxy it to the main thread. `wgpy_webgl-<version>-py3-none-any.whl` is the python library that is loaded using `await pyodide.loadPackage('path/to/wgpy_webgl-<version>-py3-none-any.whl');` in the JavaScript code or `micropip.install('path/to/wgpy_webgl-<version>-py3-none-any.whl')` in the Python code. It gives a python API that has the same interface as numpy. The wgpy can be imported as `import wgpy as wp`. A wrapper of wgpy to provide the same API as cupy is also implemented to minimize changes to Chainer (e.g. `import cupy as cp`). `wgpy_test-<version>-py3-none-any.whl` contains test code.

Here is the minimum sample code:

```python
import wgpy as wp
# transfer array to GPU
gpu_in_data = wp.asarray([1.0, 2.0, 2.5])
# compute on GPU
gpu_out_data = gpu_in_data * 2.0
# transfer array to CPU (numpy ndarray)
out_data = wp.asnumpy(gpu_out_data)
```

For compatibility with CuPy, you can also use the following code:

```python
import cupy as cp
# transfer array to GPU
gpu_in_data = cp.asarray([1.0, 2.0, 2.5])
# compute on GPU
gpu_out_data = gpu_in_data * 2.0
# transfer array to CPU (numpy ndarray)
out_data = cp.asnumpy(gpu_out_data)
```

# Run Examples

Start HTTP server:

```
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:8000 and click link to a sample.

If you access to the server from another device such as smartphones, you need to access the server by a URL starting with `https://`. Even if a URL such as `http://192.168.0.2` seems to display the page, the logic does not work. To access to the server via https URL, you can use online service such as [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).

After you install ngrok, run the command in a new terminal:

```
ngrok http 8000
```

Then access to the displayed URL (`https://*.ngrok.io`).

The reason why URLs beginning with https are required is that secure origin is needed to use the SharedArrayBuffer that this library uses internally.

# Test

## Build

```
npm run build:test
```

# Run

```
npm start
```

Open <http://localhost:8000/test/> and click TEST button. If you run only one test file, specify it in the URL such as <http://localhost:8000/test/?test_path=/test_dot.py> .

# About samples which uses Chainer

To run MNIST sample, you need the following steps.

## Creating a wheel with Chainer modified for Pyodide

```
./scripts/make-chainer-wheel.sh
```

`lib/chainer-5.4.0-py3-none-any.whl` is generated.

Chainer 5.4.0 is the last version of Chainer which contains pure-python code only. Extra work is needed to support Chainer versions with native (C++) extensions in Pyodide.

## Download and preprocess MNIST dataset

Chainer 5.4.0 is needed.

```
pip install chainer==5.4.0
```

Run:

```
python scripts/pack_mnist.py
```

`lib/mnist.zip` is generated.


## Download and preprocess CIFAR-100 dataset

Chainer 5.4.0 is needed.

```
pip install chainer==5.4.0
```

Run:

```
python scripts/pack_cifar100.py
```

`lib/cifar100.zip` is generated.
